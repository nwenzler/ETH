# Does an eulerian path exist?

We all know that remembering passwords is not easy, but writing down a password on a piece
of paper is not secure enough. That is why you decided to write down your password in an
intricate way. The password is an n + 2 characters string a1a2 . . . an+2 and you wrote down on n
separate papers all the possible three letter continuous substrings: a1a2a3, a2a3a4, . . ., anan+1an+2.
However, over time you forgot your original password as well as the order of the papers containing
the three letter substrings. To make things worse, you are not even sure if you didnâ€™t lose some
of the papers. Although not a perfect check, you want to check if you can construct at least one
string out of the papers you have.
